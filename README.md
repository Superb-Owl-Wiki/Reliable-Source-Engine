**Excluded sites** - Not all sites allowed for URL filtering-out of opinion pieces, but many did. Looking for ways to exclude (or have the option to exclude) opinion pieces from these websites - perhaps using some kind of AI-assisted search that is trained to recognize opinion pieces - ideas welcome. Other content that was excluded include blog posts, commentary, editorials, forums, search pages, author profiles, databases and redundant syndicated newswire stories.

**Status** - Not proactively maintaining but happy to answer questions and address issues. 
Last substantive update was in November 2024.
