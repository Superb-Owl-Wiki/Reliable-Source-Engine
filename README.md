# Reliable-Source-Engine
Custom search engine project page with more detail and explanation can be found at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Superb_Owl/Reliable_Source_Engine

**What is included** - Not all sites allowed for URL filtering-out of specific types of content like opinion pieces, but many did. Other content that was able to be limited somewhat include blog posts, commentary, editorials, forums, search pages, author profiles, databases and redundant syndicated newswire stories. Journal articles were not included since academic search engines are probably better able to search those.

**Status** - Not proactively maintaining but happy to answer questions and take suggestions/feedback if it continues getting used by others.
Next iteration of this is probably not with Google Custom Search Engine (limited product that requires manual maintenance to combat link rot) but something (that someone else will hopefully create) that is open-sourced and AI-enhanced that can be trained or teach itself on the types of search results that can be more easily tailored to Wikipedia editors depending on their areas of focus.
