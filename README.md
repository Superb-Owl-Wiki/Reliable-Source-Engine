Custom search engine project page with more detail and explanation can be found at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Superb_Owl/Reliable_Source_Engine

**What is included** - Not all sites allowed for URL filtering-out of specific types of content like opinion pieces, but many did. Other content that was able to be limited somewhat include blog posts, commentary, editorials, forums, search pages, author profiles, databases and redundant syndicated newswire stories. Journal articles were not included since academic search engines are probably better able to search those.

**Status** - Not proactively maintaining but happy to answer questions and address issues. 
Last substantive update was in November 2024.
Next iteration of this is probably not with Google Custom Search Engine (limited product that requires manual maintenance) but something open-sourced and AI-enhanced that can be trained or teach itself on the types of results that are most useful.
